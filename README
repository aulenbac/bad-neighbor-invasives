# README

This is a repo for an R-based analysis of non-native species occurrences in the Lower 48 U.S. (including the District of Columbia), also referred to as the Bad Neighbor analysis.  The project uses the Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) species occurrence database [https://bison.usgs.gov](https://bison.usgs.gov)

## How do I get set up?

This work is R-based.  The **DESCRIPTION** file contains all the information about the R version and library dependencies.

The project is structured in the following directories:  

**R**: the main R source code  
**data**: source data for the project  
**result_csv**: result bad neighbor summaries stored as csv  
**result_json**: result bad neighbor summaries and species lists stored as JSON  
**man**: Rendered documentation for the functions  
**graphics**: Various graphics generated as part of the analysis  


There are several notebooks outlining various aspects of the project.

1) bap_bad_neighbor_development_notes.Rmd (.html) documents the development of the functions used in the package and provides example input/output;  
2) bap_bad_neighbor_analysis.rmd (.html) documents the project and provides a results from the Bad Neighbor analysis for several taxonomic groups;  
3) grouped_species_notes.Rmd (.html) documents the development of informal taxonomic groups like tree/shrub from formal taxonomic Families.
